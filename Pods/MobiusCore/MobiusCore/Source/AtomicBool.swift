 Swift currently has no native atomics support, and also doesnâ€™t have any guarantee about atomicity for integer types.

 This is a heavyweight stopgap implementation of an atomic boolean, because the semantics of MobiusLoop are more clearly
 expressed with atomics rather than the previous implementation with locks where the invariant was unclear.
